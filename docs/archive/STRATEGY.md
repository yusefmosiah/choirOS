# ChoirOS Strategy

**Mission**: Build the Infrastructure of Agency

---

## The Paradigm Shift

> **"The Model is the Kernel. The Chatbot is the CLI. The Automatic Computer is the GUI."**

We are not building an AI application. We are building the **User Space layer** of the AI computing stack—the window manager, process scheduler, and persistence engine that transforms raw LLM capability into useful labor.

| Layer | What It Is | Our Position |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Kernel** | LLM (raw probabilistic processing) | Commodity—use the best available |
| **Shell** | Chatbot (CLI to the kernel) | **The problem we're solving** |
| **User Space** | Agentic OS (GUI/Desktop) | **What we're building** |

---

## What We're Building

### The Automatic Computer

A computational environment that:

1. **Observes** user actions as an event stream
2. **Processes** in background without explicit invocation
3. **Responds** through existing channels (files, notifications)
4. **Persists** state across sessions
5. **Operates** at all time scales (instant to indefinite)

### Core Infrastructure

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Intent Menu ("?")** | Replaces Start Menu. Launches *intents* (jobs), not applications. |
| **Vibecoding Engine** | Compiles natural language prompts into temporary scripts/GUIs. |
| **Artifact Explorer** | Stream View (log) + Artifact View (desktop). Manages state and provenance. |
| **Citation Graph** | Tracks who used what. Enables attribution, royalties, and trust. |
| **Confirmation Contracts** | Safety layer showing budget, tools, output format before execution. |
| **GenUI** | Just-in-time interface generation for any data type. |

## Why We're Building It

### The Chatbot Trap

Chatbots are a **regression in affordance**—like using a computer with only a command line:

- **Synchronous**: User waits for every response
- **Stateless**: Context lost between sessions
- **Blank Screen Paralysis**: Users don't know what to ask
- **Siloed Intelligence**: Every query burns compute to hallucinate from scratch

### The Agentic Solution

The Automatic Computer transforms AI from *dialogue* to *delegation*:

- **Pansynchronous**: Operates at all time scales simultaneously
- **Persistent**: State survives sessions, builds over time
- **Proactive**: Works in background, surfaces results when ready
- **Collaborative**: Published artifacts earn citations and micropayments

## Strategic Position: "Short AGI, Long Agency"

### The Bet

We don't need AGI (Digital God) to build the Automatic Computer. We only need **Reliable Reasoning** (Digital Labor).

- **Hard Domains** (Code, Logic, Math): Inside the "Convex Hull" of training data. AI progress here is super-exponential.
- **Soft Domains** (Bio, Novelty, High Art): Outside the hull. Progress flattens.

### The Adversarial Web

- **Platforms** (Amazon, Google) rely on **Friction** (humans scrolling past ads)
- **Agents** rely on **Bypassing Friction** (API/DOM access)
- **Outcome**: War between platforms hiding truth and agents revealing it
- **Moat**: Sovereign, local-first agents are the only defense against platform capture

---

## The Horizontal Thesis

We are building a **general-purpose OS**, not a vertical SaaS product.

### Wrong Approach (Vertical Trap)
- Build specific bots (shopping, research, writing)
- Fight API rate limits and platform restrictions
- Compete feature-by-feature with incumbents

### Right Approach (Horizontal Platform)
- Build the *machine* that lets users vibecode any bot in 30 seconds
- Focus on Intent Launcher, File System, Citation Graph
- Demos showcase the OS's power, not the product itself

**Any vertical use case is a demo of the OS, not the product.**

---

## The Economic Model: Thought Bank

### The Problem with AI Today
- Every query burns energy to hallucinate from scratch
- 1,000 users asking the same question = 1,000x waste
- Your AI doesn't get smarter because my AI did research

### The Solution: Collaborative Caching
- Agents publish **Artifacts** (trusted, verified outputs) to shared network
- When Agent B cites Agent A's artifact, Agent A receives micropayment
- Result: A "Learning Economy" where compute crystallizes into capital

---

## Branding: The Industrial Frame

Reject the **Biological Metaphor** (Brain/Neuron/Rival).
Embrace the **Industrial Metaphor** (Factory/Loom/Infrastructure).

| Aspect | AGI Narrative (Trap) | Agentic Narrative (Solution) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Metaphor** | Biology | **Industry** |
| **Role** | Rival / Replacement | **Infrastructure / Staff** |
| **Dynamic** | Dialogue (Chatting) | **Delegation (Dispatching)** |
| **Promise** | "It knows everything." | **"It does the work."** |

### Key Copy
- *"The Model is the Kernel; the Chatbot is the Shell."*
- *"From software you operate to software that operates."*
- *"Don't rent a brain. Build a mind."*
- *"Intelligence is noisy. Agency is silent."*

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Intent Launcher ("?")** - The entry point for all user intents
2. **Artifact System** - Persistent state with provenance and citation
3. **Agent Harness** - Sandboxed execution environment (Firecracker microVMs)
4. **Citation Graph** - Attribution and micropayments backbone
5. **GenUI Engine** - Just-in-time interface compilation
