# Issues (Jan 18)

Status update: 2026-01-18

## Resolved
- [x] Auth gateway stub + session issuance with passkey-shaped endpoints. (`api/routers/auth.py`, `shared/auth.py`)
- [x] Phase 0 NATS hardening: per-user subject permissions + read-only web creds. (`config/nats.conf`, `config/tenancy.json`)
- [x] Sandbox runner interface wired into verifier runner. (`supervisor/sandbox_runner.py`, `supervisor/verifier_runner.py`)
- [x] Frontend Auth UI + session management. (`choiros/src/components/apps/Auth.tsx`)

## Open
- [ ] AUTH-01 | High | WebAuthn verification is stubbed; no cryptographic checks on attestation/assertion.
- [ ] NATS-01 | High | Credentials are static; rotate per session (short-lived creds).
- [ ] NATS-02 | Medium | Browser still connects to NATS directly; consider server-side fanout (SSE/WS) for stronger isolation.
- [ ] AUTH-02 | Medium | Enforce auth on supervisor HTTP endpoints (runs/work items) + per-user event store isolation.
- [ ] NATS-03 | Medium | Move to multi-account NATS for stronger tenant isolation (Phase 1).
